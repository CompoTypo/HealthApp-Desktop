# Project readme

**Description**: There are patients struggling with diabetes or similar health related issues. An application can be designed to track and manage relevant health information including blood glucose, medications, activity, diet, and mood to help these patients recover and improve their health.

**Motivation**: We are interested in health-related topics. If we are successful, the application can be expanded upon further to help both more niche and more general ailments. It could be good.

**Similar software**: This software may be like other health related apps such as MyFitnessPal, but this software will be more specific to diabetes as more trackers and calculations must be included.

**Useful Software**: We only need to use Java because Java includes everything needed to make this software like javafx. This project will be runnable on windows.
*Risks*: Research is needed for all the medical details such as relevant medications. Possible hang-ups if we’re trying to integrate with other medical hardware.

**Iterations**: 
1. Research all health information that will be included. Build a rough/template gui, place it in a repo, and begin branching based on what group members want to do.
2. Build the bulk of the GUI. App should have several essential features.
3. Build the rest including health details, functions, calculations. 
4. Testing and debugging from the top down. 

**Meeting schedule**: 8 hours per week, Friday-Sunday are best. Group may fragment into subgroups and recombine as parts are built separately and merged together.

**Skills**: Java programming. General frontend skills will come in handy as will backend skills for structuring data of user vitals, meds, etc.
Process: XP process is sufficient. We don’t really need to worry about wasting manpower since we are all in this class anyway. It’s a good thing too since peer programming will allow for more dynamic meetings where the whole group doesn’t have to entirely meet up. In addition, everyone will be more knowledgeable about what is going on.

**Tools**: 
Github
Jira,
